## **_what is monte-carlo-localization?_**
### introduction:
<p align="justify"> Monte Carlo localization (MCL) is one of the crucial approaches for robotics localization based on particle distribution over the pre-defined map. This distribution relies on the weighted scheme for each particle. MCL approach has gained attention to remedy the global localization and kidnapping problem. However, MCL suffers from computational complexity, resulting in a delay in acquiring the accurate pose of the robot. The majority of complexity stems from the map dimension, which requires a large number of particles.
Moreover, the observation model must be presented for each particle, leading to a vast computational burden. In this repository, the MCL node (programming by Python language) for turtlebot3 in gazebo/Rviz is implemented. by proposing a pre-caching algorithm, the MCL is improved in terms of computational complexity. The Idea behind the pre-cashing scheme is to simulate the laser range finder for each grid in an off-line way. Therefore, each cell in the map includes ranges for each beam, leading to a 3D matrix. For more detail, readers can refer to Lei Zhang et al. (2012).</p>

### method:
<p align="justify"> The proposed MCL algorithm is based on four steps, initialization, motion model (prediction), observation (correction), and resampling.</p>

#### initialization:
 <p align="justify"> The algorithm remedies the global localization; for this measure, the particles are distributed all over the map, meaning the robot does not know anything about its location at the beginning.

#### motion model:
<p align="justify"> the motion model is based on velocity motion model presented in Probablstic Robotics: Sebastian Thrun et al.
